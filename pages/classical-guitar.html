            <h2>History of the Guitar</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>guitar</strong> is a stringed musical instrument that is usually <em>fretted</em> 
                (with some exceptions) and typically has six or twelve strings. It is usually held flat 
                against the player's body and played by <em>strumming</em> or <em>plucking</em> the strings 
                with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with 
                the fingers of the opposite hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three main types of modern guitar: the <strong>classical</strong> guitar, the
                steel-string <strong>acoustic</strong> guitar or <strong>electric</strong> guitar. Traditional
                acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large 
                sound hole) or the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a <em>"jazz guitar"</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings vibration, amplified by the hollow 
                body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber.

                The classical guitar is often played as a <em>solo instrument</em> using a comprehensive 
                <em>fingerstyle</em> technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's 
                fingers, as opposed to being strummed. 
                The term <em>"finger-picking"</em> can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, 
                blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.

            <h2>Alternative ways of playing the guitar</h2>
            <p>
                A guitar pick may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either 
                <em>acoustically</em>, by means of a resonant hollow chamber on the guitar, or, in the case of an 
                <em>electric</em> guitar, amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.
