            <h2>Origins and history of the guitar</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of the modern guitar are not known. Before the development of the electric guitar
                and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as being an instrument having
                "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides."
            </p>
            <p>
                The term is used to refer to a number of chordophones that were developed and used across Europe,
                beginning in the 12th century and, later, in the Americas.
            </p>
            <p>
                A 3,300-year-old stone carving of a Hittite bard playing a stringed instrument is the oldest
                iconographic representation of a chordophone, and clay plaques from Babylonia show people playing 
                a lute-like instrument which is similar to the guitar.

                The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara. The cithara was brought by the Romans
                to Spain around <time datetime="0040">40 AD.</time> In the 8th century the Moors brought the 
                four-stringed oud into Spain. The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other parts of Europe, the six-string Scandinavian lut (lute) became popular wherever the Vikings
                had been. By <time datetime="1200">1200 AD</time>, there were two types of the four string "guitar": 
                the <i lang="es">guitarra morisca</i> (Moorish guitar) from Spain which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several 
                soundholes, and the <i lang="es">guitarra latina</i> (Latin guitar) which was more like the modern guitar with one sound 
                hole and a narrower neck.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spanish vihuela, of the 16th century, was another instrument similar to the guitar. It had
                lute-style tuning and a body that was like a guitar. The vihuela was only popular for a short amount 
                of time. It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the oud and lute or 
                a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, c. <time datetime="1850">1850</time>, the form and structure of the modern guitar were developed
                by different Spanish makerssuch as Manuel de Soto y Solares and, perhaps the most important of all guitar 
                makers, Antonio Torres Jurado, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its proportions, and 
                invented thebreakthrough fan-braced pattern.

                The electric guitar was made by George Beauchamp in <time datetime="1936">1936</time>. Beauchamp co-founded a company called
                Rickenbacher to make guitars. It was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note 
                guitar solos in large big band ensembles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Eddie Durham, George Barnes, Lonnie
                Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. During the 1950s and 1960s, the 
                electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of
                the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which 
                lets players "bend" the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform vibrato effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending,
                tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.
