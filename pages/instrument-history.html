            <h2>History of the Guitar</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of the modern guitar are not known. Before the development of the electric guitar 
                and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as being an instrument having 
                "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides."

                The term is used to refer to a number of chordophones that were developed and used across Europe, 
                beginning in the 12th century and, later, in the Americas.
            </p>

                A 3,300-year-old stone carving of a Hittite bard playing a stringed instrument is the oldest iconographic
                representation of a chordophone, and clay plaques from Babylonia show people playing a lute-like 
                instrument which is similar to the guitar.

                    to indicate the antiquity of the guitar, because of the shape of its body.

                The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara. The cithara was brought by the Romans 
                to Spain around 40 AD. In the 8th century the Moors brought the four-stringed oud into Spain.
                The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara.
            </p>

                In other parts of Europe, the six-string Scandinavian lut (lute) became popular wherever the Vikings 
                had been. By 1200 AD, there were two types of the four string "guitar": the guitarra morisca 
                (Moorish guitar) from Spain which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several soundholes, 
                and the guitarra latina (Latin guitar) which was more like the modern guitar with one sound hole and a 
                narrower neck.
